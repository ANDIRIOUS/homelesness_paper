## Project Overview
- [x] Review provided documents to understand requirements and previous methodology
- [ ] Create detailed todo list and project structure
- [ ] Gather updated data on rent and homelessness in urban areas of USA
- [ ] Perform statistical analysis using R with instrumental variables approach
- [ ] Write research paper in English following guidelines in "trabajo final.pdf"
- [ ] Translate research paper to Spanish
- [ ] Create presentation slides in English
- [ ] Translate presentation slides to Spanish
- [ ] Compile and deliver final documents

## Data Collection Tasks
- [ ] Identify and access updated data sources for:
  - [ ] Homelessness data from HUD (Department of Housing and Urban Development)
  - [ ] Rent data for Continuum of Care (CoC) areas
  - [ ] Median household income data
  - [ ] Poverty percentage data
  - [ ] Unemployment rate data
  - [ ] Political affiliation data
  - [ ] Migration rate data (if available)
- [ ] Clean and preprocess collected data
- [ ] Create dataset with all necessary variables
- [ ] Create the instrumental variable (previous year's rent in adjacent CoCs)

## Statistical Analysis Tasks
- [ ] Set up R environment with necessary packages
- [ ] Perform exploratory data analysis
- [ ] Create visualizations of key relationships
- [ ] Implement instrumental variables regression:
  - [ ] First stage: regress rent on instrumental variable
  - [ ] Second stage: use predicted rent values to estimate impact on homelessness
- [ ] Validate the instrumental variable approach
- [ ] Perform robustness checks
- [ ] Analyze results for different types of homelessness (chronic vs. non-chronic)
- [ ] Document all statistical procedures and findings
